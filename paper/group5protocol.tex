\section{Introduction}
This paper defines a media streaming protocol that allows a properly implemented server to stream media to connected clients. Clients are able the join at any time during the streaming process and may be required to authenticate themselves to the server. The protocol is designed to deal with arbitrary streaming data types, including live or prerecorded video and/or audio.


\section{States}
This section describes the states of the protocol, the messages expected in those states, and the
transitions between states.

\subsection{Disconnected}
The protocol always begins in the disconnected state. The client transitions from the disconnected
to connecting state immediately after  sending the server a SessionRequest message. 
The server transitions to the connecting state upon receipt of the SessionRequest message.

\subsection{Connecting}
In the connecting state, the client will wait an implementation dependent amount of time for the 
session message. If the client does not receive the message within the timeout it will resend
the session request to the server. If the server is already processing a session request for a client
it should ignore subsequent requests.

After the server provisions the session, it sends the client a SessionMessage. This message 
contains the session id the client will use for subsequent communication with the server as
well as the challenge value for the CHAP authentication, which is described in more detail
in section~\ref{sec:security}.

\subsection{Authenticating}
After the client receives the SessionMessage containing the challenge value, it computes
a hash using the SHA-1 algorithm of the challenge value concatenated with a shared secret. The
client then sends the hash in a ChallengeResponse message to the server. The server compares
the clients hash with its own calculated hash. If the hashes match, then the server begins sending
StreamMessages to the client. If the hash comparison fails, then the server sends the client a
RechallengeMessage that contains a new challenge value. If the client fails an implementation
dependent number of challenges the server will send an AuthenticationError message to the client.

While in the authentication state, the client will remain in the Authentication state until it receives
a RechallengeMessage at which time it will calculate a the new hash and send the 
server a new ChallengeResponse. If the client receives a StreamMessage it will transition to 
the Streaming state. If the client receives no messages before the implementation dependent
timeout expires it will resend the last ChallengeResponse assuming that the packet was lost.

\section{Extensibility}
Protocol version information is included in connection messages so that the protocol version used by both sides can be established during the configuration phase.  This allows future improvements to the protocol to be implemented without rendering existing client applications unusable. In addition to this, the type of media and encoding that the stream uses are sent to the client as an ASCII-encoded string. This allows clients and servers to implement additional encodings as they are developed without updates to the protocol.

\section{Security}
\label{sec:security}
This protocol uses a CHAP-like handshaking protocol for authentication of clients.  After the connection has been established, the server sends a challenge message to the client.  Both the client and server pass a password through a pre-determined hash function, and the server checks the results and informs the client of success or failure.

\section{Reliability}
Due to the real-time nature of the protocol, it does not attempt to retransmit any lost packets. It does, however, provide sequence number on all data messages in order to ignore any packets which have reached the client after a more recently sent packet. In addition to this, each data message contains a CRC for basic error checking. When an error is detected, the packet is simply dropped.

\section{Quality of Service}
Streaming media transmission requires careful monitoring of traffic to maintain acceptable levels of loss and to avoid network congestion. These goals are achieved through the ThrottleMessage. The client sends a ThrottleMessage to inform the server that it would like to change the server's rate of transmission to that client. If the network is under a heavy load, the client will observe that packets have been lost in transit by examining sequence numbers. When this occurs, the client will request that the server decrease its current transmission rate to avoid packet loss for other services across the network. This is necessary because UDP will not perform this operation on its own like TCP would. If the client wishes to increase the rate of transmission it may do this as well, but the server is free to ignore any request that is too high.

\section{Group Contribution}
Everyone in the group contributed to this writeup. Each member contributed one or more states and messages as well as writing sections and subsections of this document. Everyone provided valuable feedback and ideas during this initial design phase of the protocol.
